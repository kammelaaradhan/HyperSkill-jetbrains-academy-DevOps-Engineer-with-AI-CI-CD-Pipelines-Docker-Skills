## Practice Q&A Summary

### Q1: Where the state of an object is stored

**Question:** The state of an object is stored in its...

**Options:**
- fields (or attributes) ✅
- friends
- source code
- methods
- class

**Answer:** `fields (or attributes)`

---

### Q2: What can be characterized by a state and behavior?

**Options:**
- field (or attribute)
- method
- object ✅
- class

**Answer:** `object`

---

### Q3: Match the Main OOP Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Class** | Type of an object |
| **Field** | State of an object |
| **Method** | Behavior of an object |
| **Object** | An individual instance of a class |

---

### Q4: The units of an object-oriented program

**Question:** Every object-oriented program essentially consists of a set of...

**Options:**
- interacting methods
- interacting variables
- interacting classes
- interacting objects ✅

**Answer:** `interacting objects`

---

### Q5: Find one WRONG statement about methods

**Options:**
- Objects interact with each other through invoking methods ✓
- An object may have no methods at all ✓
- The state of an object is represented by its methods ❌ **WRONG**
- An object may have characteristics: fields and methods ✓

**Answer:** `The state of an object is represented by its methods` (This is WRONG because state is represented by **fields**, not methods!)

---

## Key Takeaways

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Class** | Blueprint/template for creating objects |
| **Object** | Instance of a class with state + behavior |
| **Field/Attribute** | Stores the **state** (data) of an object |
| **Method** | Defines the **behavior** (actions) of an object |

### Core OOP Principle:
> **Objects = State (Fields) + Behavior (Methods)**

An OOP program is essentially a collection of **interacting objects** that communicate by invoking each other's methods.
